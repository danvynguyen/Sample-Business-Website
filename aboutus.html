            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p class="info">From its humble beginnings operating from Rodrigo Falcone's Studford dorm room, Empura has grown to become a multinational comglomerate spanning across numerous countries, realms, nations, continents, and most importantly, people like you and me. Empura prides itself on its deep commitment to friends, family, and fun. Our success has been built on our corporate synergy, customer-centric incentive, our hyperlocal quotas, and our no-nonsense, by the rules, ecosystem that vales freemium touchpoints and "move the needle" big data and core competency. TLDR; "Our most valuable export is not our cars, our coffee, but delivering smiles." Not only do we think outside the box but our best practice is that unlike other corporations/yuppy trash, we reach out to our touch base and stakeholders. You can trust Empura to "put a pin in it."</p>

                    <h2>The Secret to our Success</h2>
                    <p>From being a leading developer in Artificial Intelligence and survellience to smaller scale projects such as the franchisation of Kreative Koffee which has opened nearly 150 shops across all realms, Empura has become a trusted household name known for its commitment to its clueless consumers, I meant customers. The secret of our success lies in our "by-the-numbers" approach based on our policy of "following the instructions." Our valuable workforce of like-minded employees all share our vision of the future ensuring that our company runs smoothly and crushes any semblence of individuality and dissent. Empura is also known as the first company to implement artificial intelligence into its workforce which is another aspect that gives Empura its advantage.</p>

                    <h2>About our CEO</h2>
                    <p>Rodrigo Falcone had a vision when he first founded Empura. A vision he wanted to share with the world. A bright future of everyone working side by side, creating a more stable and safe world through business and technology. He's attended several prestigious universities, which is where he famously wrote his Award-Winning Master's Degree Paper, "Law, Order, and the Master-Builder: A Rope of Sand." Not much else is known about his past but he claims he had a mostly average upbringing and says that his high school years were the best years of his life. He has won the "Most Handsome Man of The Year Award" every year since 1992. In 2005, he opened the Empura Tech division where he developed some of the first fully-operating robots to be used for work purposes.</p>

                    <h2>Employee Showcase: Steve</h2>
                    <p>Pictured above is Robot #25 a.k.a "Steve." Steve is a member of our marketing department. Recently, he's been responsible for re-designing our website, Steve has rightfully earned his spot in the employee showcase because he has demonstrated everything Empura represents. But if we get negative feedback from his re-design, we won't hesitate to fire him too.</p>
